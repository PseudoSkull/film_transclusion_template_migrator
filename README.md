This is a maintenance tool that was used on all film transcriptions on the English Wikisource. It replaced <div> tags wrapping the {{Page}} template, with the new {{Film transclusion}} template at Wikisource. That template was made so that the styling of the film transcriptions could remain consistent sitewide.
